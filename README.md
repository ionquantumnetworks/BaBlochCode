# Barium Bloch Code
Barium Bloch code for 8 levels
This subbranch is for John's code that allows for beams to be in any direction.
We are holding off on merging until we've tested it works in general, but at this point it works for linearly polarized light at an arbitrary angle to the magnetic field.
